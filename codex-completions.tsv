I can't seem to figure it out. Can you? Hopefully, some one can give me a hand on this one.

Well, I think, number 0 in octal is 01. Well, the question is,
combine the two numbers, and get the correct output. Here are my explanations.

What the question exactly wants to get is the result of oct("	"def a(n):

Next, write a function to score whether a ping pong game is “fair”. A game is fair if it terminates when the first of 2 players reaches a score of 21.

To keep things simple, for each game we only keep track of the current player and what the current score is.

Write a function tripleprint that takes in one string input_string and prints the string three times in one line.
Let us see what are the steps in building the function:
  1. Initiatilze"	print([k for k in range(1, 105) if k % 3])	" a list. Long lines can be folded by adding a backslash at the end, as in:
 sequence = os.walk(\
 '/home/ramyh/Documents/Books/Deep Learning/Code/Dataset 1').
This is called line continuation. The resulting list, sequence, contains the tupple returned by os.walk()

What is printed is the list of numbers that satisfy this condition. Here is the list of numbers when n = 10.

This way of finding Fibonacci numbers works very well, if we only want numbers up to some upper bound of the limit. 
For larger limits, it is too slow just to use function recursion to generate the values.
Such a large example would take quite a long time to finish just generating a Fibonacci number
